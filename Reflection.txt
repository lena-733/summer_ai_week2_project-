This project was hard because I have never implemented this type of code before, so I needed to ask for help at office hours. I also wanted to do the extra steps outside depth and breadth first search but I don't think I could have done it in time. I have learned more about python variables and AI as well and how to implement it in code. I enjoyed it. I used Google to search up errors to figure out what was wrong, and specifically used W3schools for example to help with this. I had to use that webiste for understanding what a tuple is.
